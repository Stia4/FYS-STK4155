# FYS-STK4155

This is the shared repository for code used in Project 1 in course FYS-STK4155 Fall 2022, for members Dennis $\hat{\text{H}}$ Fremstad, Stian Aannerud, Marius Bjerke BÃ¸rvind, and Andreas Wetzel.

Python files contain main function definitions used for analysis and regression, while the Jupyter notebooks are mainly used for running and generaing the larger contour plots for Ridge and Lasso. To generate the plots used in our report, all the Python code and Jupyter notebooks are used. Running the main Python programs requires an installation of Python3, with all packages used including 'numpy', 'matplotlib', and 'sklearn', as well as others. The Jupyter notebooks require a Jupyter enviroment as well as the requirements from the Python code.

Selected figures which we use are added to the folder 'fig', and most of our code saves figures to this folder by default.

Data used in our project can be found in the aptly named folder 'data'. Two datasets are included, but we have only used set 'SRTM_data_Norway_2.tif' for our analysis.
